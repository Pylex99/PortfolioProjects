Data Analyst Portfolio: Exploring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Real-world Data

This project showcases my adeptness in SQL data manipulation through a comprehensive exploration of Nashville Housing Data. 
By meticulously addressing data quality issues, such as standardizing date formats, rectifying missing property addresses, 
splitting composite address fields, and transforming categorical data, I demonstrate my proficiency in handling complex data 
preprocessing tasks. The project illustrates how my SQL skills can lead to organized, accurate, and actionable insights, 
making it a valuable representation of my abilities for potential employers seeking a detail-oriented and skilled data professional.
Key Data Manipulation Tasks

The project focuses on several critical data manipulation tasks:

    Standardizing Date Format: Ensuring consistency in date formats for accurate analysis.

    Populating Property Addresses: Rectifying missing or empty property addresses.

    Breaking Down Composite Addresses: Splitting composite address fields into individual columns for clarity.

    Transforming Categorical Data: Converting categorical values to more interpretable formats.

    Handling Duplicate Records: Efficiently identifying and removing duplicate entries.

SQL Techniques Demonstrated

The project employs a variety of SQL techniques to clean and transform the Nashville Housing Data:

    Date Function Usage: Employing SQL functions to standardize and manipulate date data.
    Data Validation: Identifying and rectifying missing or empty values.
    Join and Update Operations: Utilizing joins and update operations to populate missing data.
    String Manipulation: Splitting composite address fields using string manipulation functions.
    Conditional Transformations: Transforming categorical values based on specific conditions.
    Duplicate Removal: Detecting and efficiently removing duplicate records.

The Nashville Housing Data Cleaning project demonstrates my ability to transform and optimize complex datasets, 
ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data before analysis. By effectively handling data preprocessing challenges, 
I reinforce my commitment to producing reliable and actionable insights from intricate data sources.
