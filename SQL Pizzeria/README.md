Pizzeria Profits Report: Orders and Revenue - Data Analysis for Visualization Project

In this GitHub portfolio project, I present an in-depth analysis of pizza sales data from a Pizzeria business using MySQL queries. 
This analysis is a crucial step before creating visualizations in PowerBI and Tableau to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the presented data. 
The dataset, containing information about pizza orders, quantities, prices, and dates, has been meticulously examined to derive key insights 
that will guide the subsequent visualization process.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analyzed:

    Total Revenue: The total revenue generated from pizza sales is calculated to be approximately $817,860.05.
    Average Order Value: The average order value is determined to be around $38.31.
    Total Pizzas Sold: A total of 49,574 pizzas have been sold.
    Total Number of Orders: The dataset comprises 21,350 distinct orders.
    Average Number of Pizzas Per Order: On average, each order consists of about 2.32 pizzas.

Trends Analyzed:

    Daily Trend for Total Orders: The dataset is explored to identify the distribution of total orders across different days of the week. 
    Fridays and Saturdays are the busiest days, with 3,538 and 3,158 orders respectively, while Sundays see the lowest number with 2,624 orders.

    Monthly Trend for Orders: The analysis further extends to monthly trends, revealing that July, May, and January are the months with the highest order counts.

    Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category and Size: Sales distribution is examined across pizza categories and sizes. Classic, Veggie, Supreme, 
    and Chicken are the top categories, contributing approximately 26.91%, 23.68%, 25.46%, and 23.96% respectively to the total sales revenue. 
    Large-sized pizzas account for the majority of the revenue at 45.89%, followed by Medium (30.49%) and Small (21.77%).
