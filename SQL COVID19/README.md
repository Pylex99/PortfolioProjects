Data Analyst Portfolio: Exploring, Analyzing, and Visualizing Real-world Data

In this GitHub portfolio project, I present an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data using MySQL queries. This analysis aims to uncover significant insights from the dataset, which includes information about COVID-19 cases and vaccinations. The exploration of this data serves as a crucial preliminary step before creating visualizations in tools like PowerBI and Tableau, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the presented information.
Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

    Data Overview: Extract and present key details from the COVID-19 dataset, such as total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population.

    Infection and Fatality Analysis: Investigate the relationship between total cases and total deaths, calculating fatality percentages to understand the severity of the pandemic.

    Global and Regional Insights: Explore global and regional trends, analyzing death counts and infection rates.

    Vaccination Analysis: Examine vaccination data in relation to population, identifying trends and percentages of vaccinated individuals.

    Data Transformation for Visualization: Utilize various SQL techniques to transform and manipulate data for later visualization.

SQL Techniques Employed

This project utilizes a variety of SQL techniques to derive insights from the COVID-19 dataset:

    Joins: Combining data from different tables for comprehensive analysis.
    CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Creating intermediate result sets for complex calculations.
    Temporary Tables: Storing and manipulating data temporarily to simplify analysis.
    Window Functions: Performing calculations across rows to extract trends.
    Aggregate Functions: Calculating sums and percentages for meaningful insights.
    Creating Views: Storing transformed data in views to facilitate visualization.

The COVID-19 Data Exploration project showcases my proficiency in SQL data analysis, enabling me to uncover significant insights from complex datasets. By applying various SQL techniques to extract meaningful information, this project sets the stage for creating accurate and impactful visualizations.

Feel free to explore the provided SQL queries and use them as a foundation for visualization or further analysis.
